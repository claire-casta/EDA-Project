# Exploratory Data Analysis Project - Customer Loans in Finance

## Project Brief
You currently work for a large financial institution, where managing loans is a critical component of business operations.

To ensure informed decisions are made about loan approvals and risk is efficiently managed, your task is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data.

Your task is to perform exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data.

This information will enable the business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.

By conducting exploratory data analysis on the loan data, you aim to gain a deeper understanding of the risk and return associated with the business' loans.

Ultimately, your goal is to improve the performance and profitability of the loan portfolio.

## Project Description
A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned.

This project takes a financial loan dataset in .csv file format and exploratory data analysis is performed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.

The exploratory data analysis has several steps built into the project:
1. Extract the data from the cloud.
2. Initial data exploration to gain an overview of the dataframe.
3. Convert column to the correct format
4. Removing or imputing missing (null value) data
5. Perform transformations on skewed data columns
6. Identifying and removing outliers from the data
7. Identifying and dropping overly correlated columns
8. Analysis and visualisation to draw deeper insights
